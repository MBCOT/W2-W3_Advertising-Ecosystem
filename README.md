# Web2 -> Web3 Advertising Ecosystem

## Introduction
The Web2 -> Web3 Advertising Ecosystem represents a paradigm shift in the advertising industry, leveraging blockchain technology to create a transparent and incentivized ecosystem for advertisers, publishers, and users. By bridging the gap between traditional web advertising (Web2) and decentralized web technologies (Web3), this innovative platform aims to revolutionize the way advertising is conducted and monetized on the internet.

## Key Components
1. **Advertising Tokens:** Web2 sites publish advertising tokens, which are fetched via a third-party API. These tokens serve as incentives for users to engage with advertisements and participate in the ecosystem.

2. **User Engagement:** Users scan QR codes from webpages using Minima DApps to obtain advertising tokens. By watching advertisements associated with these tokens, users contribute to the advertising ecosystem and earn rewards.

3. **Advertiser Notification:** Upon watching an advertisement, users notify over Maxima the advertisers, triggering a reward mechanism. Both the user and the Web2 site hosting the advertisement are rewarded if they provide a secret code showed after the advertisement view.

4. **Smart Contract Governance:** The ecosystem is governed by smart contracts, ensuring transparent and automated reward distribution based on predefined rules and conditionson every loto, bet, gambling system created. 

## Functionality
The platform enables seamless interaction between advertisers, publishers, and users, facilitating the monetization of advertising content in a decentralized and transparent manner. Users are incentivized to engage with advertisements, while advertisers and publishers benefit from increased visibility and engagement.

## MDAE Project Integration
The Web2 -> Web3 Advertising Ecosystem serves as a mini version of the MDAE (Minima Decentralized Advertising Ecosystem) project, offering similar functionality and benefits. The MDAE project, available at [github.com/MBCOT/MDAE](https://github.com/MBCOT/MDAE), provides a comprehensive solution for decentralized advertising on the Minima blockchain.

## Conclusion
The Web2 -> Web3 Advertising Ecosystem represents a groundbreaking initiative in the advertising space, combining the power of blockchain technology with traditional web advertising practices. By incentivizing user engagement, ensuring transparency, and automating reward distribution, the platform offers a promising solution for advertisers, publishers, and users alike. With its integration of smart contracts and alignment with the principles of decentralization, the ecosystem has the potential to reshape the advertising landscape and drive innovation in the Web3 era.
